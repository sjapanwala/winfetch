## What Is Winfetch?
- To understand what **Winfetch** is, we need to understand what **Neofetch** is. Neofetch is a command-line utility used primarily in Unix-like operating systems (such as Linux distributions) to display system information in the terminal. It gathers information about the system's operating system, kernel version, desktop environment, hardware, and other relevant details, and presents them in a visually appealing ASCII art or text-based format.
